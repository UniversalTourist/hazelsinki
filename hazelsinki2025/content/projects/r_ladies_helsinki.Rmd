## Organisation
[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org) is a great organisation where people come together, learn and collaborate with each other while being in a safe space. 

You can read the mission of the organisation [here](https://rladies.org/about-us/mission/). 

## Helsinki Chapter

I was the organiser of R-Ladies Istanbul for about 3 years. After I moved to Helsinki I met the lovely organisers of Helsinki chapter and after sometime I took over the chapter. I am very happy to part of this organisation and spread the love and joy of creating things together. 

You can follow Helsinki events from [Meetup.com page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-helsinki/). 

We have run couple of events throughout the years and starting to bring the joy of learning back to Helsinki very soon. Stay tuned!
