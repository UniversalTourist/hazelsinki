Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Hazel** â€” a data analyst by day, swing dancer by night ðŸ’ƒ

With over 8 years in the **gaming industry**, Iâ€™ve worked at studios like Seriously, Rovio, and Supercell to level up their game â€” literally. I specialize in:
- ðŸŽ® Level progression and player behavior analysis  
- ðŸ“Š Designing insightful dashboards and A/B tests  
- ðŸ§© Collaborating with cross-functional teams to uncover meaningful game insights

I love turning messy data into clear stories â€” using **SQL**, **R**, and **Shiny** to build tools that empower teams and speed up smart decision-making.

    <p>Outside the data world, I wear a few other hats:<br>
   ðŸ’ƒ I teach Lindy Hop at Black Peppers in Helsinki â€” itâ€™s all about rhythm, joy, and connection.<br>
   ðŸ’ª I keep moving with body training to stay grounded and strong.<br>
   ðŸŽ¶ And when things slow down, I strum a little ukulele â€” music helps me recharge and stay playful.</p>

    <p>ðŸŽ‰Iâ€™m also deeply involved in building inclusive tech spaces.</p>
    <p>I organize events for R-Ladies Helsinki, a local community focused on supporting gender diversity in R and data science.  
Before that, I was the founder and organizer of R-Ladies Istanbul, which I led for three amazing years.</p>

ðŸ“¬ Always happy to connect â€” whether itâ€™s about data, dancing, teaching, or tunes.  
**Looking forward to hearing from you.**

Cheers,
