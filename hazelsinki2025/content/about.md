Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Hazel** â€” a data analyst by day, swing dancer by night ðŸ’ƒ

With over 8 years in the **gaming industry**, Iâ€™ve worked studios like Seriously, Rovio and Supercell level up their game â€” literally. I have strong experience in:
- ðŸŽ® Level progression and player behavior analysis  
- ðŸ“Š Designing insightful dashboards and A/B tests  
- ðŸ§© Collaborating with cross-functional teams to uncover meaningful game insights

Iâ€™m all about turning messy data into clear stories â€” using **SQL**, **R**, and **Shiny** to create tools that empower teams and speed up smart decision-making.

Outside the data world, I wear a few other hats:

- ðŸ’ƒ I teach **Lindy Hop** at **Black Peppers** in Helsinki â€” itâ€™s all about rhythm, joy, and connection.
- ðŸ’ª I keep moving with **body training** to stay grounded and strong.
- ðŸŽ¶ And when things slow down, I strum a little **ukulele** â€” music helps me recharge and stay playful.

ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™m also deeply involved in building inclusive tech spaces.

I organize events for **R-Ladies Helsinki**, a local community focused on supporting gender diversity in R and data science.  
Before that, I was the **founder and organizer of R-Ladies Istanbul**, which I led for three amazing years.

ðŸ“¬ Always happy to connect â€” whether itâ€™s about data, dancing, teaching, or tunes.  
**Looking forward to hearing from you.**

Cheers,  
Hazel
