Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Hazel** â€” a data analyst by day, swing dancer by night ðŸ’ƒ

I am originally from Istanbul and Iâ€™ve been living in Helsinki for more than 6 years now. I absolutely love it here! ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® I'm fluent in Finnish at a B1 level (I even passed the YKI test!). Itâ€™s been a rewarding journey embracing both the culture and the language.

Iâ€™ve spent over 8 years in the gaming industry, working with studios like Seriously, Rovio, and Supercell â€” helping out on projects that made games a bit more fun and players a bit more hooked.I specialize in:
- ðŸŽ® Level progression and player behavior analysis  
- ðŸ“Š Designing insightful dashboards and A/B tests  
- ðŸ§© Collaborating with cross-functional teams to uncover meaningful game insights

I love turning messy data into clear stories â€” using **SQL**, **R**, and **Shiny** to build tools that empower teams and speed up smart decision-making.

    <p>Outside the data world, I wear a few other hats:<br>
   ðŸ’ƒ I teach Lindy Hop at Black Pepper Swing in Helsinki â€” itâ€™s all about rhythm, joy, and connection.<br>
   ðŸ’ª I keep moving with body training to stay grounded and strong.<br>
   ðŸŽ¶ And when things slow down, I strum a little ukulele â€” music helps me recharge and stay playful.</p>

    <p>ðŸŽ‰Iâ€™m also deeply involved in building inclusive tech spaces.</p>
    <p>I organize events for R-Ladies Helsinki, a local community focused on supporting gender diversity in R and data science.  
Before that, I was the founder and organizer of R-Ladies Istanbul, which I led for three amazing years.</p>
