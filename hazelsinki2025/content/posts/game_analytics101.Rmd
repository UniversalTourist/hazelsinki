There are many tools available now that can help your team to make the product ready faster than ever. Although the key metrics your team needs to focus are still the same. AI can help you generate content, personalize experiences, and even predict user behavior. But if you don’t understand the **key metrics** — your DAU, retention, ARPU, session lengths, conversion funnels — you’re basically flying blind.

Knowing what’s happening in your game — and more importantly, *why* — will always be relevant.

This is **Game Analytics 101**. And it’s still your foundation.

## What Metrics Still Matter (And Always Will)

- DAU/WAU/MAU
- Retention (D1/D7/D30)
- ARPU / ARPPU / LTV
- Session length & frequency
- Conversion funnels (e.g., FTUE to first spend)
- Event-level behavior
