As someone who works in mobile game analytics, I find it really cool how the game balances engagement mechanics with monetization.&lt;/p>

Although the key metrics teams need to focus are still the same. AI can help us generate content, personalize experiences, and even predict user behavior. But if teams don‚Äôt follow the &lt;strong>key metrics&lt;/strong> ‚Äî DAU, retention, ARPU, session lengths, conversion funnels ‚Äî it is basically flying blind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is always good to emphasis the importance of communication in the team and with every craft. As data analyst embedded in game teams I prefer to discuss many things earlier with the feature owners, developers and QA.

&lt;p>I am originally from Istanbul and I‚Äôve been living in Helsinki for more than 6 years now. I absolutely love it here! üá´üáÆ I&amp;rsquo;m fluent in Finnish at a B1 level (I even passed the YKI test!). It‚Äôs been a rewarding journey embracing both the culture and the language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I‚Äôve spent over 8 years in the gaming industry, working with studios like Seriously, Rovio, and Supercell ‚Äî helping out on projects that made games a bit more fun and players a bit more hooked.I specialize in:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bl√ºdhaven</title><link>https://superlative-snickerdoodle-13f9c6.netlify.app/projects/bludhaven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://superlative-snickerdoodle-13f9c6.netlify.app/projects/bludhaven/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="history">History&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Bl√ºdhaven was a former whaling town, which was officially incorporated as a &amp;ldquo;Commonwealth&amp;rdquo; in 1912.
